List of Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter (softened)
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)
Powdered sugar (for dusting)
Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a baking pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips if using.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Dust with powdered sugar before serving if desired.
